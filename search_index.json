The assignments are roughly based on 10 periods of 1-2 weeks. Depending on the length of your internship you will be given a schedule when to finish each assignments. 1.1 Goal of the assignments The assignments laid out in this guide are meant to familiarize you with the most important literature and thought framework of ITP research. Through systematic inquiry of the provided assignments you will expand your knowledge and consolidate learning points that you encounter during your day-to-day work. The literature provided here will also provide a basis for your scientific report. The skills you learn in the writing assignment ensure that you have the necessary skills to structure a formal report and use citation software, well before you have to use it in your final report. 1.2 How assignments work Each period you will start a reading assignment. You will have a 15 minute pre-discussion at the start of the period convering what the topic is about and why it is important. Then you will do your readings and answer the questions provided. This should not take more than 2 hours per assignment. Divide your time over the expected effort and continue to the next part if you are stuck in the middle. At the end of each period, you will have a post-discussion (± 30min) discussing your answers and any open questions. 1.3 Grading Performance and effort in the assignments will be considered for interim and final assessment of the trainee.

["open-science-writing-assignment.html", "2 Open Science Writing Assignment 2.1 Expected result 2.2 Reading / starting points 2.3 Reference Management", " 2 Open Science Writing Assignment The purpose of this exercise is to learn about current developments in the way science is being practiced. The name of the exercise hints to the Open science movement, which aims to give a broader audience access to research. However, we will also briefly explore a current reproducibility movement and good scientific practices. This exercise is also meant to make you familiar with writing a scientific document, getting access to peer-reviewed articles, and using citation software. This will come in useful when you write your final project report. Don’t read too much - the main goal here is to form a conceptual idea, bring it down to paper, and show that you can use a citation software. 2.1 Expected result Two A4 page essay, structured references (at least 3) should be given in Vancouver style on a third page Give your own opinion and a considered argumentation about the following question: should scientific data be shared publicly with publication? Consider the benefits of sharing data and possible negative or unintended effects. Close the essay with a conclusion and describe how to practice in the future 2.2 Reading / starting points Find out what the mission of the journal PLOS is in regard to publishing openly Get an overview of what Open access means Check the website of the Center for Open Science Read Bohannon J. Many psychology papers fail replication test. Science (2015); 349(6251). Read Warren E. Strengthening Research through Data Sharing. NEJM (2016); 375. 2.3 Reference Management Use a reference management program like Zotero or Mendley to make your reference list. If you don’t have one yet you can check the website from York University discussing the two. If your institution has already supplied you with another program (e.g. Endnote or Papers) you are of course free to use this. "],
